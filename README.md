# TRIO-DOC
The Real Internet Organization

Our organization originated in China.

As we all know, the Chinese government has built a giant firewall. Therefore, China's Internet cannot connect with the Internet around the world.

In such an environment, a number of monopolistic companies were born in China, such as Baidu and CSDN. After obtaining a monopoly, these companies monopolized Internet traffic and then began to destroy the Internet.

The most typical example is that as a search engine, Baidu's first page of search results is already full of advertisements and has almost no available information. Even if you search for some well-known companies and software, the search results displayed by Baidu are still junk companies that paid Baidu.Similarly, as a knowledge sharing website, CSDN used to be almost free. But now, CSDN even includes content that is completely free on the world's Internet into its own website, and then starts charging for them. All this is because it is on the Chinese Internet rather than the world Internet. Its monopoly position makes the Chinese helpless.

TRIO plans to continuously launch network services and purify Chinaâ€™s Internet. TRIO hopes that through its efforts, users can restore the fast, efficient and free experience they had on the Internet more than ten years ago. We believe that this is also the original intention of the Internet, which is to be open and shareable.
